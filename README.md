# Customer Churn Prediction ML Model

## Problem Statement

The objective of this project is to develop a churn prediction model for a subscription-based business. Churn refers to the situation when customers discontinue using a product or service. By analyzing customer data and patterns, the aim is to predict which customers are most likely to churn in the near future, so proactive measures can be taken to retain them.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains historical data on customer characteristics, usage patterns, and churn status. It includes the following columns:

- Customer ID: Unique identifier for each customer.
- Gender: Gender of the customer (Male/Female).
- Age: Age of the customer.
- Tenure: Number of months the customer has been with the company.
- Service type: Type of service subscribed by the customer.
- Monthly charges: The amount charged to the customer per month.
- Total charges: The total amount charged to the customer over their tenure.
- Churn: Whether the customer has churned or not (Yes/No).

## Approach

The project will follow the following steps:

1. Data Preprocessing: Clean the dataset by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical variables if necessary.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis: Perform exploratory analysis to gain insights into the dataset, understand patterns, and identify any correlations or trends related to churn.

3. Feature Selection: Identify the most relevant features that contribute to churn prediction using techniques such as correlation analysis, feature importance, or feature selection algorithms.

4. Model Development: Develop and compare different machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, or Neural Networks to predict churn. Optimize the models using techniques like hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation.

5. Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the models using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and area under the ROC curve. Compare the models to select the best-performing one.

6. Deployment and Monitoring: Deploy the churn prediction model in a production environment, and continuously monitor its performance and recalibrate if necessary.

## Results

The expected outcome of this project is a churn prediction model that can accurately identify customers at the highest risk of churning. This will enable the business to take proactive measures to retain those customers, resulting in increased customer retention and improved business performance.

## Conclusion

Churn prediction is a critical task for businesses that rely on subscription-based models. By leveraging historical customer data and applying machine learning techniques, this project aims to develop an effective churn prediction model to help businesses reduce customer churn and improve overall customer satisfaction.
